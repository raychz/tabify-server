# Tabify-Server

Tabify's NestJS API and TypeORM database.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

### Installing

Follow these steps to get a local dev environment set up.

1. Create a local environment .env file and populate it with the necessary values. See [dotenv-flow](https://github.com/kerimdzhanov/dotenv-flow) for details on how the environment variables in the .env directory are loaded into process.env. Note that all .local files are git-ignored to avoid checking in sensitive keys and passwords.

```
cp .env.development .env.development.local
// Fill in the key-value pairs in .env.development.local
```

2. Initialize a local MySQL database using Docker Compose.

```
docker-compose up
```

3. Verify that the container was started successfuly and that its state is `Up`.

```
docker-compose ps
```

4. Install the dependencies.

```
yarn install
```

5. Run the development server.
```
yarn start:dev
```

6. Make a test GET request by opening your browser to http://localhost:3000, using a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), or simply using Curl.
```
curl localhost:3000
```

If you see a message about a missing auth token, you've successfully started the server! ðŸŽ‰
